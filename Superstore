For example, using the e-commerce data of SUPERSTORE, a data analyst could answer business questions like:

    What items were sold?
    How many items were sold?
    How long do users spend on the SUPERSTORE website?
    How long on average does it take for a customer to make a purchase on the SUPERSTORE website? 

How long do users spend on the SUPERSTORE website?
SELECT SUM(session_duration)
FROM ecom_data;

How long do users spend on the SUPERSTORE website per item?
SELECT SUM(session_duration), item_name
FROM ecom_data
GROUP BY item_name

Order the items by price:
SELECT *
FROM superstore
ORDER BY price;

SELECT SUM(price)
FROM superstore
WHERE price>=300
GROUP BY item_name;

Can also show a statistic about the item prices, like a sum, average, minimum, maximum, or count using the list of aggregation functions (SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX and COUNT)
